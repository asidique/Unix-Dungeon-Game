echo -e "The smell of bacon is getting suffocating and starving you. There is still darkness all around. You see a door to your east. It is broken... strange. This can't be good.

To your north is a dark hallway.
To your south is a dark hallway.
To your east is a broken door. What could have broken it?
To your west is a wall.
