echo -e "The hallway seems to be getting even darker the farther you go. 
You hear something approaching! Brace yourself for some action!

There is another door in this hall that is to your west and east. The door in the west looks familiar to the door you were just in.

To your north is more darkness that you may travel through.
To your south is the hall from which you came from.
To your east is a door.
To your west is a half-open door."
