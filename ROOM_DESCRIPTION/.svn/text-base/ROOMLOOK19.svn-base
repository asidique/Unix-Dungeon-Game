echo -e "No it's definitely the light. It is beaming bright. You haven't seen light in hours! Down the hallway to the north is where the light is coming from but a shiny door to your east reads 'Awesome Treasure awaits'. Tough decisions.

To your north is a bright wooden door.
To your south is a hallway.
To your east is a shiny door that reads 'Awesome Treasures await!'
To your west is a wall.
