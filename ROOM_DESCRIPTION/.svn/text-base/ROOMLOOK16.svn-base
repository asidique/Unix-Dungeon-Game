echo -e "You walk on a pressure plate and a suffocating gas is released (and no it doesn't smell like bacon, although you wish it would). Run!

The hall continues down to the north but there is rubble you may go through. You should probably evade the gas and enter the rubble!

To your north is a dark hallway.
To your south is a dark hallway.
To your east is rubble. It seems you can fit through.
To your west is a wall.
