echo -e "As you crawl through the rubble, there is laughter. But they're not your laughs. You look up and see the DUNGEON MASTER! Prepare yourself!

The room has a strange magical mist. Behind the monster is a crawling space. What could be there?

To your north is a wall.
To your south is a wall.
To your east is crawling space.
To your west is rubble. It seems you can fit through.
