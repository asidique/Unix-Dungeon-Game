echo -e "You see the exit. There is a lock on the exit.

You smell bacon so strong at this point that you feel as if it is right in front of you. Hah what hallucinations you must be having...

But standing right in front of you is a pig.

Bacon.

This is not any ordinary pig however; this is a giant, horned and half-cooked breathing pig. It's staring right at you. Get ready to fight!

To your north is a steel door with a lock.
To your south is a wooden door.
To your east is a wall.
To your west is a wall.
