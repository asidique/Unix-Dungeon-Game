echo -e "As the bacon smell continues to grow and the hallways get colder, you begin to become frightened. You see a golden door to your west, but your sick of attempting to go through doors, hoping there's some kind of exit. Should you try this door?

To your north is a dark hallway.
To your south is a hall from which you came from.
To your east is a wall.
To your west is a golden door. Interesting...?
