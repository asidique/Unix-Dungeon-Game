You see and hear almost nothing in the first room. It smells like old bacon and dirt. There is a door to your east, but the hall continues down north. You should probably check the door first, in case you get lost.

To your north you see more darkness that you may travel through.
To your south is a blocked entrance. 
To your east is a half open door.
To your west is a wall.
